Title: Linked List Sum Combinations

Given a Double linked list, your objective is to find the number of unique ways three nodes can be selected from the list such that their sum is precisely equal to zero.

Return an integer representing the number of unique ways three nodes can be selected from the linked list such that their sum is zero.
Constraints:
The value of each node's val lies within the range of -10^9 to 10^9.

Note:
The linked list can be empty (head is None), and in that case, return 0 as there are no nodes to select.
The output may be large, so return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
