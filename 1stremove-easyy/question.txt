Suppose you are given a linked list that represents a sequence of operations to perform on an LL. Each node in the linked list has a numeric value indicating the number of elements to skip.The operations are as follows:

If the value is 0, continue.
If the value is positive (e.g., 2, 3, etc.), it represents skipping the next 'value' number of elements in the array.
For example, consider the linked list: 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0

1- 1 , so skip the next one node( value 0)
2-2, skip the next 2 nodes( values 0,0)
3-0 , print and continue
4-1, skip the next one node(value -0)

Output = 0
