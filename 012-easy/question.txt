As part of the challenge, you are presented with a unique array containing only three elements: 0, 1, and 2. Your task is to create a linked list by sorting this array in ascending order.
In Time complexity of O(n)

To accomplish this, you must implement a function that takes the input array and returns the head node of the linked list. The linked list should be created in such a way that it represents the sorted order of the elements: 0, 1, and 2.

Note:
You are required to create the linked list in place, without using any additional data structures, and using only constant space.
The order of elements in the linked list should correspond to the sorted order of the elements in the input array.
